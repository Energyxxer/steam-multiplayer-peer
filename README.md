## Features

✔️ Easily change ENet peer to Steam Peer

✔️ Use Steam Sockets (Low level like ENet).

✔️ GDExtension (Easy to add your project)
 
✔️ No dependency with GodotSteam, but demo uses GodotSteam to handle connections with lobbies ([See lobbies tutorial in Godot Steam here](https://godotsteam.com/tutorials/lobbies/)).


## GodotSteam SteamMultiplayerPeer Differences

| Differences | This SteamMultiplayerPeer | GodotSteam SteamMultiplayerPeer |
|---|---|---|
| Lib Type | GDExtension, easy to add through the [asset library](https://godotengine.org/asset-library/asset/2258). | C++ module, requires precompiled Godot version <br>from GodotSteam, or compile yourself |
| Steam Connection | Steam Sockets [Steam Docs](https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/api/ISteamNetworkingSockets)<br>Steam's lowest connection level,<br>manages a connection <br>(It's very close to Enet, <br>that's why I chose this approach for the plugin) | Steam Messages [Steam Docs](https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/api/ISteamNetworkingMessages)<br>Without a connection idea,<br>the connection is managed by the lobby,<br>Need Steam lobbies. |

## Known issues

⚠️ No channel support currently
- It's been concluded that it's a limitation of the socket system, I'll take it out of the plan for now. See issue (https://github.com/expressobits/steam-multiplayer-peer/issues/2)
